# げんき（な）
1. What if you wanted to use an adjective in a negative sense (not new, not cute, not young, etc.)? You can conjugate them!
3. な-adjectives conjugate with the “suffix” じゃない.
3. Take the adjective げんき（な）(it means energetic).

# げんきじゃない

1. To make it negative, you will drop the な and add じゃない.

# げんきじゃない  せんせい

1. You can then work with this adjective like normal (by placing it in front of a noun).
2. So this is a “not” energetic (un-energetic) teacher.

# きれいじゃない  つくえ

1. This is a not-clean desk (a desk that is not clean).
2. These may sound awkward in English, but they are very natural to use in Japanese!

# あたらしい → あたらしくない

1. い-adjectives work in a slightly different way - instead of じゃない, they become negative using くない.
2. You will drop the final い when you add くない.
3. So あたらしくない is “not new”.

# かわいい → かわいくない

1. This is “not cute”.

# いい → よくない 

1. There is only one irregular adjective in Japanese, and it is いい (good).
2. When いい conjugates, it acts as if it were よい、so in the negative, it becomes よくない.

# よくない  がくせい

1. Let’s see some examples with nouns.
2. This is a not-good student.

# あたらしくない  いえ     

1. And this is a not-new house.

# かわいくない  ねこ

1. Lastly, a not-cute cat. (As if there was such a thing!)

# ふる い → ふるくて

あお い → あおくて  

すばらし い → すばらしくて

1.  You’re doing great! Let’s tackle one more way of using adjectives.
2. If you want to use two or more adjectives in succession (like a cute, famous, yellow cat), you will conjugate adjectives there too.
3. い-adjectives will drop the い like before, and add くて.
4. As mentioned before, いい will conjugate as if it were よい, becoming よくて.

# ちいさくなくて

しずか じゃなくて

1. You can also use negative adjectives - な or い - the same way.
2. Just remove the い at the end and add くて!

# ひま → ひまで

すてき → すてき 

で  いや → いや で 

1.  な-adjectives will conjugate by dropping the な and adding で.

# かわいくて 、ゆうめいで 、きいろい  ねこ

1. This is a  cute, famous, yellow cat!
2. Once you get these adjective spelling rules down, your sentences will get quite a nice boost!
