# Casual Speech            

1. Now that you're feeling fairly comfortable with the polite verbs, let's talk about more casual speech!
2. Polite verbs, or the ます forms, are used when talking in a formal situation (like a classroom), or with people we don't know.
3. On the other hand, when we feel close with someone, like our friends and family members, we don't want to be quite so formal.
4. Using these casual verbs shows our closeness with the person.
5. In English, we see this most often in terms of address: when we're being formal, we will use prefixes like “Mr.” or “Ms.” and a person's last name, but we are on a first-name basis with our friends.

# Using the Dictionary form

1. The Dictionary form of the verb is also the present (and future) positive verb in casual speech!
2. So you don't need to worry about any conjugations here.

# 起きる

話す

来る

1. Ichidan, Godan, and irregular verbs will use their dictionary forms this way.

# ８時 に 起きます→８時 に 起きる

 日本語 を 話します→日本語 を 話す

 銀行 に 来ます→銀行 に 来る

1. All of the rules of word order, particles, etc., stay the same.
2. Don't forget to tap on the words for more information about them!
3. There will be some times when you can drop some of your particles, like を, but for now, we can leave them as they are!

# Negative   

1. To make verbs negative in casual speech is a little different than for ます and ません.
2. Again, let's look at our three types of verbs: Ichidan, Godan, and Irregular.

# 食べる→食べない

 始める→始めない

 閉める→閉めない 

1. Ichidan verbs will work similarly to the verb forms we've looked at before: you will drop the る, and add the negative ending ない.
2. So “don't eat” would be たべない,  はじめない is to “not begin”, and “don't close” is しめない.

# 書く→書かない

待つ→待たない
作る→作らない

1. For our Godan verbs, we will be using another one of our vowel 'steps.'  
2. This time, we use the 'a' step. So the vowel of the last character will change to 'a,' and then negative ない will be added.
3. In this way, we can see that “don't write” is かかない, “don't wait” is またない, and つくらない is to “not make”.

# 買う→買わない

会う→会わない

1. Godan verbs that end in う have a special variation - instead of ending in -あない, we change the あ to a わ instead.
2. So we'll say かわない instead of かあない for “don't buy” and あわない is to “not meet”.

#  ある→ない

1. There is also one verb that is only irregular in the casual negative tense.
2. Instead of ある becoming あらない, it just becomes ない!
3. This is why, when we talk about adjectives, we can use じゃありません or じゃない！But more on that later.

# する→しない

来(く)る→来(こ)ない

1. Our two fully irregular verbs, する andくる, do not follow the same pattern.
2. So, you'll just need to remember that しない is to “not do”, and “don't come” is こない.
3. (If you are using kanji: note that the reading of the 来 kanji changes, so the verb is pronounced こない.)  

# ドア を 閉めません→ドア を 閉めない

コーヒー を 買いません→コーヒー を 買わない
学校 に 来ません→学校 に 来ない

1. Just like with our positive casual forms, the negative forms work exactly the same as polite forms in terms of grammar.

#  です→だ 

1. There's one last “verb” to talk about: our old friend, です!
2. Although です doesn't function like the other verbs, since it never ends in ます, it still has formal and casual forms.
3. です is the polite form of the word: the dictionary/casual form is だ 

# 私 は カオです→私 は カオ だ

辞書 は 大きいです→辞書 は 大きい だ
彼女 は 静かです→彼女 は 静か だ

1. So those sentences we learned way back at the beginning of our exploration into Japanese, where we had AはBです, can now be changed to AはBだ.
2. Any sentence that ends with です in more formal speech can end with だ in casual speech.

#  辞書 は 大きいです→辞書 は 大きい 

1. With い adjectives, you can take it even one step further, and drop the です・だ entirely at the end of a sentence!
2. The same thing works with negative nouns or adjectives - remember, when we make a noun or adjective negative, it conjugates just like an い adjective!

# 私 は カオ じゃないです→私 は カオ じゃない

辞書 は 大きくない です→辞書 は 大きくない
彼女 は 静かじゃない です→彼女 は 静かじゃない

1. So whether you're negating a noun or an adjective, you can do away with です・だ entirely in casual speech.
2. While casual speech can seem easier to use due to the simpler conjugations rules, don't forget that it should only be used with those you are closer to.
