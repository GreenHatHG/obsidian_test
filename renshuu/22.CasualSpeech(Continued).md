1. Now that you're feeling comfortable with casual speech in the present tense, let's look at the past tense!

# 起きる→起きた

見る→見た
出る→出た

1. Again, we'll be looking at our three verb forms separately.
2. For Ichidan verbs, you will add the past tense ending た to the verb stem (which, if you remember, is the dictionary form minus the final る).
3. Just as always, all Ichidan verbs will work in this way.

# する→した

来る→来た

1. The irregular verbs will work in the same way.
2. So you will add た to the verb stems し and き.

# 使う→使った

休む→休んだ
聞く→聞いた
消す→消した

1. Godan verbs will conjugate exactly the same way as they did for the て form, so it will work in groups, depending on the final character.
2. If a verb ends in う、つ、or る (for example: つかう, もつ, or かえる), you will drop the last character and add った.
3. So つかう becomes つかった、もつ becomes もった、and かえる becomes かえった.
4. If a verb ends in む、ぶ、or ぬ (for example: やすむ, あそぶ, or しぬ), you will drop the last character and add んだ.
5. Thus, やすむ becomes やすんだ、あそぶ becomes あそんだ、and しぬ becomes しんだ.
6. If a verb ends with く (or ぐ) (for example: きく、かく or いそぐ), you will drop the last character and add いた (or いだ if it ended in ぐ).
7. In this way, きく becomes きいた、かく becomes かいた、 and いそぐ becomes いそいだ.
8. Just like in the て form, いく (行く) is our lone exception.
9. Instead of becoming いいた、it conjugates as いった.
10. Lastly, if a verb ends in す (like けす or だす), you will drop the last character and add した.
11. So けす becomes けした and だす becomes だした.

#  だ (です)→だった 

1. The last 'verb' to talk about is だ.
2. Remember, だ is the dictionary form of です.
3. In the past tense, だ becomes だった.

# 会社員 だった

有名だった

1. So if you're speaking casually about someone who was once an office worker (noun), or something that was once famous (na-adjective), you could use だった instead of でした.

#  可愛かった 

1. For い adjectives, just like in the present tense, you can eliminate the verb です・だ entirely, and just use the past tense adjective alone.

#  ~なかった 

1. The negative past tense works the same for everything - nouns, both types of adjectives, and all verbs!
2. Why is that? Because all negative conjugations end in い!

# (Noun) じゃない→じゃなかった

(な Adjective) じゃない→じゃなかった
(い Adjective) くない→くなかった
(Verb) ない→なかった

1. So no matter what type of word you are making past and negative, you will start with the casual present tense, drop the い at the end, and add the past tense かった that we learned with adjectives earlier.
2. This time, though, there is no need for a final です.
3. So if something wasn't an apple, or wasn't important, or it wasn't warm (isn't that a fun word to say?), they will all become past tense in the exact same way.
4. Isn't that convenient?
5. The same goes for verbs, like the above three: didn't wake up, didn't play, and didn't come.
6. Congratulations! You've knocked out another major conjugation form in Japanese.
