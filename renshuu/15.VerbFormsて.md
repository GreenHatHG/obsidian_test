# て form

1. You’ve been doing so well with these lessons, it’s time for something new!
2. In this lesson, we will learn a new verb form, usually called the て form, that has a variety of uses.

# Conjugation

1. The first thing we’ll talk about is how to make the て form.
2. Just like with the ます forms that we talked about earlier, you will need to know if the verb you’re dealing with is an Ichidan, Godan, or one of our two irregular verbs.

# たべる → たべて

1. For Ichidan verbs, creating the て form is very straightforward: you find the verb stem by removing the る, and then you will add て.

# みる → みて

ねる → ねて

いる → いて

1. All Ichidan verbs will work in this way.

# くる → きて

する → して

1. The two irregular verbs, くる and する, actually follow a similar pattern here.
2. Since the ます form of くる and する are きます and します, think of き and し as the verb ‘stems’.
3. So the て form of these two verbs are きて and して, respectively.

# まつ → まって

のむ → のんで

かく → かいて

はなす → はなして

1. For Godan verbs, the て form conjugation depends on the last character of the dictionary verb.
2. They will divide into four groups.
3. For Godan verbs, the て form conjugation depends on the last character of the dictionary verb.
4. If a verb ends in う、つ、or る (for example: あう, まつ, or とる), you will drop the last character and add って.
5. So あう will become あって, まつ becomes まって, とる becomes とって, and so on.
6. If a verb ends in む、ぶ、or ぬ (for example: のむ, よぶ, or しぬ), you will drop the last character and add んで.
7. So のむ will become のんで, よぶ becomes よんで, しぬ becomes しんで, etc.
8. If a verb ends with く (or ぐ) (for example: かく, きく, or およぐ), you will drop the last character and add いて (or いで if it ended in ぐ).
9. So かく will become かいて, きく becomes きいて, and およぐ will become およいで.
10. There is one exception to this rule, and it is the verb いく - it doesn’t become いいて、 but instead it changes to いって.
11. Lastly, if a verb ends in す (like はなす or けす), you will drop the last character and add して.
12. So はなす will become はなして, and けす becomes けして.

# ほん  を  よんで  ねます 。

1. Up until now, we have only used one verb in a sentence, but what if you do multiple actions?
2. That is where the て form comes in: **it links two or more verbs to describe several activities**.
3. The て form kind of acts like the English phrase “and then” here: I did this thing, and then I did that thing.
4. We use the て form and not particle と that we already learned because と can only link two nouns.
5. **Using this pattern of Verb 1 て Verb 2 shows us that one action was completed, and then the second.**
6. So if you are going to read a book and go to bed, you would say this.
7. The actions can be closely related like the above sentence, or more loosely.
8. You could list all the things you did in one day just by using the て form!
9. The last verb in the sentence will be conjugated like normal, and will show the tense for all of the actions.

# きのう  おおさか  に  いって ばんごはん  を  たべました 。

1. For example, if you went to Osaka yesterday and ate dinner there, you could use this sentence.

2. This is just one usage for this very versatile verb form!

3. Take a look at the next few lessons for more ways to use the て form.
