# すき  きらい  ほしい
1. Here are a few somewhat special adjectives for you. (这里有一些对你来说有些特殊的形容词。)
2. In English, ‘like,’ ‘dislike’ and ‘want’ are all verbs. However, in Japanese, they’re adjectives. すき and きらい are both な-adjectives, and ほしい is an い-adjective.
5. You can think about this as “A is liked” or “B is wanted.”

# わたし  は  うま  が  すき  です 。

1. Let’s take a look at this sentence. This means “I like horses.”
2. We have a new particle here, が, which can also be used to show a subject. You will learn more about the differences between は and が later.
3. For now, just know that は tells us the topic, or main subject, of the sentence (わたし, I), and **が shows a secondary subject; in this case, what is liked.**

# うま  が  すき  です 。

1. You can also omit the main subject entirely, especially if you’re talking about yourself, or if the subject is understood from the conversation.

# リンゴ  が  すき  です 。

1. Here's another example: I like apples.

# えいが  が  きらい  です 。

1. You can swap すき out with きらい (dislike) like this: I dislike (don't like) movies.

# みず  が  ほしい  です 。

1. And ほしい can be used for things you want: I want water.

# だいすき / だいきらい

1. If you want to show stronger feelings (love or hate), you can add the prefix だい to either すき or きらい.
2. **So だいすき would be love.**
3. **And だいきらい would be hate.**

# カオ  が  だいすき  です 。

1. **Be careful when you’re talking about people though: just like in English, saying you ‘really like’ someone can indicate you have a romantic interest in them!** 浪漫的兴趣

# コーヒー  が  すきじゃない です。

1. What if you DON’T like/dislike/want something? You can make these adjectives negative just like the others we learned previously.
2. So this would be: I don't like coffee.

# コーヒー が きらいじゃない です。

1. And this would be: I don't hate coffee. (But it sounds like you don't really like it, either!)  

# コーヒー が ほしくない です。         

1. And this would be: I don't want coffee.
2. Just remember that が follows the thing you like/hate/want, and すき/きらい/ほしい comes at the end!
