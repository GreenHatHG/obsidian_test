1. In this lesson we’ll look at two more particles that can be used to add more variety into your sentences.

# も

1. The first particle we’ll look at in this lesson is も.

も works like the English words “also,” or “too,” and shows that two sentences have something in common.

# A は B です。 C も B です。            

1. Here is the most basic way we can use も.
2. Subjects ‘A’ and ‘C’ both have a trait, ‘B’ in common.
3. も replaces particle は to show this common ground.

# わたし は がくせい です。

かれ も がくせい です。

1. Take this pair of sentences, for example.
2. “I am a student.
3. He is also a student” The two people have being a student in common.

# すし は おいしい です。

ラーメン も おいしい です。            

1. We can also use this with adjectives - sushi is delicious, and ramen is delicious too!

# わたし は ラーメン を たべます。

カオ も ラーメン を たべます。

1. You can also use も to say that two (or more) people do the same thing!
2. I eat ramen, and Kao eats ramen too.

# わたし は ラーメン を たべます。

カオ も  たべます。

1. You can also leave your second sentence with only the new piece and the verb - も tells us that the rest of the sentence is the same.
2. This would be like saying “...and Kao does, too” which sounds more natural than repeating the whole sentence!

# みず  を  のみます 。

おちゃ  も  のみます 。

1. You can replace particles を and が with も in the same way, too!
2. You can see that at work in these sentences.

# みず  が  すき  です 。

おちゃ  も  すき  です 。

1. I drink water.
2. I also drink tea.
3. I like water, I also like tea.

# ろくじ  に  たべます 。

じゅうにじ  にも  たべます 。

1. With particles に and で, however, we can’t just replace them with も.
2. Instead, we add the two particles together!
3. So if you do something at more than one time (like eating at 6 o’clock and 12 o’clock), you will use にも in your second sentence.

# とうきょう  に  いきます 。

おおさか  にも  いきます 。

1. Or if you go to more than one place (like Tokyo and Osaka).

# うち  で  にほんご  を  はなします 。

がっこう  でも  にほんご  を  はなします 。

1. Likewise, if you do something in more than one place, you will combine で and も together too.
2. “I speak Japanese at home.
3. I also speak Japanese at school.”  Like before, you can also drop everything but your different place and your verb, so it sounds more natural.
4. “I speak it at school, too.”

# と   

1. The last particle we’ll look at for now is と.
2. This works like the English word ‘and,’ and will connect two or more nouns: they could be subjects, objects, places, times, etc.
3. While も shows an addition, and is usually written as “too” or “as well”, と connects words together as a set.
4. も usually comes in a second sentence (Think: “I want to play. Me, too!”), while と is in the same sentence (“He and I want to play.”)  

# りんご  と  オレンジ  が  すき  です 。

1. When you say “I like apples and oranges,” it feels a little different than when we said “I like water.
2. I also like tea” earlier, doesn’t it?

# にく  と  さかな  を  たべます 。

1. Using particle と you can eat or drink multiple things, go multiple places, or do something in multiple places as well.
2. So this would be 'I eat meat and fish.' (in the same setting)  

# うち  と  がっこう  で  にほんご  を  はなします 。

1. And this is “I speak Japanese at home and at school.”  

# とうきょう  と  おおさか  に  いきます 。

1. Again, using と implies a closer relationship than if we’d used も like before.
2. For example, “I will go to Tokyo and Osaka” implies you’re going to both on the same trip, while “I will go to Tokyo.
3. I will also (も) go to Osaka” seems like you might take separate trips, one to each place.

# カオ と  ともだち  は  えいが  を  みます 。

1. カオ は  ともだち  と  えいが  を  みます 。

2. The particle と can also be used to show with whom you do something.

3. Take a look at these two sentences: notice the difference?

4. In the first sentence, Kao and a friend watch a movie.

5. In the second, Kao watches a movie with a friend.

6. It’s a subtle difference, but the gist is that in the first sentence, there are two subjects who are equally important.

7. In the second, Kao is the only subject, and the friend is secondary - maybe it’s someone we don’t know, or maybe it’s just more important that Kao is watching the movie!

8. With も and と, you can further expand your sentences by using multiple subjects, objects, and more in your Japanese!
