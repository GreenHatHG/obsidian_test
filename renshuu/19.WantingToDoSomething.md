# Wanting

1. We talked about making requests previously, but what if you want to just talk about things you want to do, or place an order?
2. In Japanese, placing an order is easy!

# ～を ください

 ～を 下さいませんか 

1. If you want someone to give you an object, for example, if you are ordering food in a restaurant, you can use either (object)をください or (object)をくださいませんか 
2. Both of these endings work exactly the same, they just differ in politeness.
3. くださいませんか is more formal than ください.

# ラーメン を ください 。

いす を 下さいませんか？

1. If you were in a restaurant and wanted to order ramen, saying ラーメンをください, or “Ramen, please,” would be perfectly appropriate.
2. If it was a more formal situation, or a more significant request, you might be extra polite.
3. いすをくださいませんか would be more like asking “Could I possibly get a chair, please?”

# ～たい  

～ たいです

1. If you want to talk about things you would like to do, there’s a verb form for that!
2. **The たい form of the verb expresses the phrase “I want to~” in English.**
3. We use the たい form to talk about our own actions.
4. Other people’s wants and feelings are usually spoken about as a report or an observation, instead.
5. Talking about what other people (seem to) want and feel will be discussed in another lesson.
6. We form it by finding the verb stem, as we talked about when we learned the polite forms of the verb, and adding たい instead of ます or ません.

# 食たべる  → 食たべた い  

寝る  → 寝 たい     

1. Remember, to find the verb stem for Ichidan verbs, you just cut off the る, so now you will add たい to the verb stem.
2. たべたい would mean “I want to eat,” and ねたい means “I want to sleep.”  

# 遊ぶ → 遊びたい

書かく  → 書かきたい 

1. To find the verb stem for Godan verbs, you will change the last character from the -u step (like ぶ in あそぶ) to the -i step (for example, あそび).
2. Now we add たい, and we get あそびたい, “I want to play.” かきたい means “I want to write.”  

# する  → したい

来る  → 来たい 

1. When we get to our two irregular verbs, we have to just remember the verb stems.
2. The verb stem for する is し, so “I want to do” is したい、and the stem of くる is き, so we get きたい for “I want to come.”

# 食べたいです

1. You can either end your sentence with the たい form of the verb, or you can almost treat it like an adjective and tack です onto the end, if you want to be more polite.
2. You can use the ～たい form of the verb just like the other verbs we’ve learned, the rules for particles will remain the same.
3. So if you want to eat sushi, you can say すしをたべたい（です）.

# 一時 に 学校 に 行きたい。

一時 に 学校 に 行きたいです。

1. You can use times and places in the same way as well.
2. You could use either of these phrases to say “I want to go to school at 1:00.”  

# 図書館 で 勉強したくない。

図書館 で 勉強したくない です。

1. The たい form will conjugate like an い-adjective.
2. “I don’t want to study at the library” would look like one of these.

# 日本 に 来たかった。

日本 に 来たかったです。

1. If you wanted to do something in the past, you would also conjugate たい as an い-adjective, so saying “I wanted to come to Japan” looks like either of these.

# １０時 に 寝たくなかった。

１０時 に 寝たくなかった です。

1. And, if you didn’t want to sleep at 10, these two are how you could say it.
2. Don't forget, the たい forms can only be used like this when describing your own wants.
