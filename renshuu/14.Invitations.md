# ませんか

ましょう  

ましょうか    

1. In this lesson, we will look at a few different ways to invite someone to do something with us.

# ~ ませんか

1. The first kind of invitation we will look at is the most polite, and uses the negative verb ending ません that we already learned, plus the question particle か.
2. This is kind of similar to the phrase “won’t you…?” in English.
3. For example, the Alphabet Song ends with the line “next time won’t you sing with me?”  

# おちゃ  を  のみ ませんか 。

1. You can use all the particles we have already learned in your invitation as well to make them as specific as you want.
2. This would be “Would you like to have some tea?”  

# いちじ  に  ひるごはん  を  たべ ませんか 。

1. This would be “Would you like to have lunch at 1:00?”  

# としょかん  で  ほん  を  よみ ませんか 。

1. And this would be “Would you like to read books at the library?”

# ~ ましょう

 ~ ましょうか         

1. The next type of invitation we will look at is still polite, but not quite as formal as ませんか.
2. This uses a new variation on the ます form, ましょう.
3. You can also add the question particle か to the end.
4. You will conjugate this form the same way you would any polite verb, but you will end with ましょう instead of ます or ません.

# およぎ ましょう

およぎ ましょうか

1. Using ましょう more closely aligns with the English phrase “Let’s …”, while ましょうか is more like “Shall we…?”  
2. So およぎましょう would be “Let’s swim!”, while およぎましょうか would be “Shall we swim?” 

# テニス  を  し ましょう 。

1.  Just like with our other invitations, you can use ましょう and ましょうか with all the other particles we have learned.
2. So this would be “Let’s play tennis!”  

# さん  じ  に  いき ましょうか 。

1. And this would be “Shall we go at 3:00?”  

# しゃしん  を  とり ましょうか 。

1. You can also use ましょうか to offer assistance.
2. For example, if you are offering to take a photo of someone, you can say しゃしんをとりましょうか, which you can translate as either “Shall I take a photo (of you)?” or “Would you like me to take a photo?”
3. To recap, the suffix ませんか can be used for polite invitations.
4. ましょう is the most casual, and is closer to “Let's ..”, and ましょうか (“Shall we ..”) falls in the middle.
