1. In Japanese, there are two kinds of adjectives: い-adjectives and な-adjectives.  
2. They are named for their last character when they attach to nouns.                   

# ちいさい  ほん

1.     First, let’s take a look at this phrase.
2.     The word ちいさい is an い-adjective, meaning ‘small’.
3.     ほん is ’book’, so this phrase means ‘a small book’.

# おおきい  ほん

1.     We could also have a big book.

# かわいい  いぬ

1.     And we’ve got a cute dog.
2.     Notice that the word order is the same as in English - the adjective comes before the noun.

# しずか な  ひと

1.     It works the same way for a な-adjective. Look at the phrase above.
2.     しずか（な）means ‘quiet’ (notice the な is often written in parentheses in a dictionary; more on that later).
3.     ひと is ‘person’, so this phrase means ‘a quiet person’.

# げんきな  がくせい    

1.     We could also have an energetic student.

# きれいな  へや

1.     Or we could have a pretty room.

# じしょ  は  おおきい  ほん  です 。

1.     We can add these phrases into our AはBです pattern that we already learned.
2.     The above reads: a dictionary (じしょ) is a big book (おおきい ほん).

# かのじょ  は  しずか な  ひと  です 。

1.     She (かのじょ) is a quiet person (しずかな ひと).

# じしょ  は  おおきい  です 。

1.     You could also drop the noun and just place an adjective before です。
2.     This would read as: (the) dictionary is big.

# かのじょ  は  しずか  です 。

1.     She is quiet.
2.     Notice that in this pattern, AはAdjectiveです, you do not include the な in the な-adjective.
3.     It is only used when modifying a noun. (しずか な かのじょ)
4.     This is why some dictionaries will write it as しずか（な）.
5.     It helps show that it is an な-adjective, but lets you know that you don't always need it. (Only if it's before a noun!)
