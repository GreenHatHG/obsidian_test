# Requests

1. Let’s talk about how to make requests in Japanese.

# ください

1. If you want to make a request of someone, the word ください will be very useful.
2. It means ‘please,’ as in ‘please (do something)’ or ‘please (give me x)’.

# みず  を  ください 。

1. If the request is for a thing, it is very easy to make the request - you will say Noun + をください.
2. So if you would like some water, for example at a restaurant, you could use this sentence.

# じかん  を  ください 。

1. It doesn’t matter if the noun in question is a physical object or something more abstract.
2. For example, if you would like more time (to do something), you might say this sentence.

# かいて  ください    

1. Another way to use ください is with actions.
2. You will use the て form we learned earlier with this type of request, with ください at the end.

# なまえ  を  かいて  ください 。

1. For example, if you wanted someone to write their name, you would say this.

# すし  を  たべて  ください 。

1. You can also use this type of request to show someone’s allowed to do something.
2. If you bought sushi to share, you might say this to let someone know they can feel free to have some!

# どうぞ すし を たべて ください。

1. You could also add どうぞ to the beginning as emphasis.

# のんで  も  いい  ですか ？

1. What if you want to do something, but you’re not sure if you’re allowed?
2. Then you will use the て form of the verb, along with the phrase もいいですか？
3. This is like asking “Is it ok if I …?”  

# みず  を  のんで  も  いい  ですか ？

1. So if you want to drink water but you’re not sure if it’s allowed, you might ask this.

# ここ  に  すわって  も  いい  ですか ？

1. Or if you aren’t sure if a seat is open, you might ask this.

2. You might respond to such a request with はい、どうぞ！

3. With the phrases ください and てもいいですか, we can ask for things as well as ask if we can do something!
